# LifeCounterDesk
### In progress - MTG life counter

This is a small project to make a life counter for Magic: The Gathering.
It's also a chance for me to give CSS Grid a go too.

### It's *nearly* operational :grin:
- The life counter is fine, but I want to add functioning poison and energy counters
- Then I need to make it pretty!
- I'd also like to add a Cordova wrapper to it soon.
